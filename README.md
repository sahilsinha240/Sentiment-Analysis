# Sentiment-Analysis
<h1>Intoduction</h1>

Sentiment analysis is used to analyze customer reactions to products. Now you have learned the basics of the working purpose of nltk used in NLP projects. In this project there are so many steps to complete the whole project.

Steps

Step 1:- Read in Data and NLTK Basics

In this step, we was first import packages like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlip, Seaborn, NLTK in Python. Then use Pandas to read the data, then Matplotlib to read Quick EDA, then starts Basic from NLTK.

Step 2:- VADER Seniment Scoring

I will use NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to get the neg/neu/pos scores of the text.
This uses a "bag of words" approach:
Stop words are removed
each word is scored and combined to a total score.
And at the end of this step I will Plot the VADER result.

Step 3:- Roberta Pretrained Model

Stop words are removed
each word is scored and combined to a total score.
Use a model trained of a large corpus of data.
Transformer model accounts for the words but also the context related to other words.
And at last Compare Scores between models.

Step 4:- Combine and compare

Step 5:- Review Examples:

Positive 1-Star and Negative 5-Star Reviews
Lets look at some examples where the model scoring and review score differ the most.

Step 6:- The Transformers Pipeline

Quick & easy way to run sentiment predictions.
